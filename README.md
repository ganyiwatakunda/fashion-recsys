# fashion-recommender-system
This is a model of a Fashion Recommender System using the KNearest neighbor algorithm to make predictions. This sysytem allows users to input a sample images e.g shirt or trousers and the functionality of the model is to output 5 images that are most closest or similar to the inputted image. This is of a great advantage as it helps one to chose what he really wants and it makes easy the process of e-buying, by recommending images.
